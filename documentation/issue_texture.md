## Load Texture

[OpenGL integer texture raising GL_INVALID_VALUE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59542891/opengl-integer-texture-raising-gl-invalid-value/59544753#59544753), [three.js]

First of all you have to create an [OpenGL Context](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Context). e.g.:   
(See also [Using OpenGL With SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/guidevideoopengl.html))

```cpp
if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0)
    return 0;

SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("ogl wnd", 0, 0, width, height, SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL);
if (window == nullptr)
    return 0;
SDL_GLContext context = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);

if (glewInit() != GLEW_OK)
    return 0;
``` 

Then you have to generate an texture name by [`glGenTextures`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGenTextures.xhtml):

```cpp
GLuint tobj;
glGenTextures(1, &tobj);
```

After that you've to bind the named texture to a texturing target by [`glBindTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTexture.xhtml):

```cpp
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tobj);
```

Finally you can specify the two-dimensional texture image by [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml)

```cpp
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_R32UI, 3072, 2048, 0, GL_RED_INTEGER, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, nullptr);
```

Note, the texture format has to be `GL_RED_INTEGER` rather than `GL_RED`, because the source texture image has to be interpreted as integral data, rather than normalized floating point data. The *format* and *type* parameter specify the format of the source data. The *internalformat* parameter specifies the format of the target texture image.

You have to set the texture minifying function (`GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER`) by [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml) ( this can be done before `glTexImage2D`):

```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
```  

If you are not generating [mipmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap) (with [`glGenerateMipmap`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGenerateMipmap.xhtml)) it is important to set `GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER`. Since the default filter is `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR`, the texture would be "Mipmap Incomplete" if you do not change the minimize function to `GL_NEAREST` or `GL_LINEAR`.

### `glBindTexture`

[OpenGL/C++: Problem passing multiple textures to one shader](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55959818/opengl-c-problem-passing-multiple-textures-to-one-shader/55959867#55959867)  

fter the name (value) of the texture is generated by [`glGenTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGenTextures.xhtml), the named texture has to be bound to a texturing target by [`glBindTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTexture.xhtml), before the texture image is specified by [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml).  
`glTexImage2D` defines the texture images for the texture, which is currently bound to the specified target:

```cpp
glGenTextures(1, &texture); 

// [...]

glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture); 
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, format, width, height, 0, format, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data);
```  

### `glTexImage2D`

[glTexImage2D 'target is not valid'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48196668/glteximage2d-target-is-not-valid/48196727#48196727), [C++]  

The fist parameter of [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) is the `target`, which must be `GL_TEXTURE_2D`, `GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D`, `GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY` [...].  
[`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) specifies the two-dimensional texture for the texture object that is bound to the current [Texture unit](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Texture#Texture_image_units).

See [OpenGL 4.6 core profile specification - 8.5. TEXTURE IMAGE SPECIFICATION, page 212](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf):

>The command
>

>is used to specify a two-dimensional texture image. target must be one of `TEXTURE_2D` for a two-dimensional texture, `TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY` for a onedimensional array texture, `TEXTURE_RECTANGLE` for a rectangle texture, or one of the cube map face targets from table [...]

### `glTexSubImage3D`

[(LWJGL3) OpenGL 2D Texture Array stays empty after uploading image data with glTexSubImage3D](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52355123/lwjgl3-opengl-2d-texture-array-stays-empty-after-uploading-image-data-with-glt/52355184#52355184), [Java]  

It is not an error to pass a `width`, `height` or `depth` of 0 to `glTexSubImage3D`, but it won't have any effect to the texture objects data store.

### `glTexStorage`

[OpenGL 3.2 Why am I getting INVALID_ENUM error for glTexStorage3D?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49827961/opengl-3-2-why-am-i-getting-invalid-enum-error-for-gltexstorage3d/49828443#49828443), [C++]  

`GL_RGBA` is not a valid enum constant for the the 3rd paramter of [`glTexStorage3D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexStorage3D.xhtml).

[OpenGL 4.6 API Core Profile Specification; 8.19. IMMUTABLE-FORMAT TEXTURE IMAGES; page 272](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf):

### Load Bitmap

[How to load a bmp on GLUT to use it as a texture?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12518111/how-to-load-a-bmp-on-glut-to-use-it-as-a-texture/50641676#50641676), [C++] [GLUT]  

A simple solution would be to use [STB library](https://stb.handmade.network/), which can be found at [GitHub - nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

All what is needed is one source file, the header file "stb_image.h".

Include the header file and enable image reading by the setting the preprocessor define `STB_IMAGE IMPLEMENTATION`: 

```cpp
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include <stb_image.h>
```

The image file can be read by the function `stbi_load`:

```cpp
const char *filename = .....; // path and filename
int         req_channels = 3; // 3 color channels of BMP-file   

int width = 0, height = 0, channels = 0;
stbi_uc *image = stbi_load(filename, &width, &height, &channels, req_channels);
```

When an RGB image is loaded to a texture object, GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT needs to be set to 1. By default GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT is 4, so each line of an image is assumed to be aligned to 4 bytes. The pixels in the buffer have a size of 3 bytes and are tightly packed, this would cause a misalignment.
After loading the image, the memory on the can be freed by `stbi_image_free`:  

```cpp
GLuint texture_obj = 0;
if ( image != nullptr )
{
    glGenTextures(1, &texture_obj);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_obj);
  
    glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, width, height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, image);
    glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 4); // default

    stbi_image_free( image );
}
```

[Texture colors replaced by purple tones](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54174087/texture-colors-replaced-by-purple-tones/54179559#54179559), [Nim]  

The [Portable Network Graphics (PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) file may contain 32-bit RGBA colors.

Force the `stbi_load` to generate an image with 4 color channels, by explicitly pass 4 to the last parameter:

```py
imageData = stbi_load("Test/2d-rendering-test./stack.png",
                      addr texWidth, addr texHeight, addr channelCount, 4)
```

See [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h):

>     Basic usage (see HDR discussion below for HDR usage):
          int x,y,n;
          unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
          // ... process data if not NULL ...
          // ... x = width, y = height, n = # 8-bit components per pixel ...
> **`// ... replace '0' with '1'..'4' to force that many components per pixel`**

>           // ... but 'n' will always be the number that it would have been if you said 0
          stbi_image_free(data)

---

`stbi_load` can be forced to generate an image with 4 color channels, by explicitly pass 4 to the last parameter:

See [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h):

>     Basic usage (see HDR discussion below for HDR usage):
          int x,y,n;
          unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
          // ... process data if not NULL ...
          // ... x = width, y = height, n = # 8-bit components per pixel ...
> **`// ... replace '0' with '1'..'4' to force that many components per pixel`**

>           // ... but 'n' will always be the number that it would have been if you said 0
          stbi_image_free(data)

In this case the format parameter has to be changed from `GL_RGB` to `GL_RGBA` when loading the image: 

    unsigned char* imageData = stbi_load(filePath.c_str(),
         &width, &height, &numComponents, 0);

    // [...]

    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGBA,
                 GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, imageData);

### Windows Bitmap

[OpenGL Texture Loading issue with images that Crossed each other](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53051066/opengl-texture-loading-issue-with-images-that-crossed-each-other/53051516#53051516), [C]  

A [Windows Bitmap](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Bitmap) file has a file header of 54 bytes. I this header is the format of the file encoded.

## Texture alignment (GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT)

[Calculating texture coordinates from a heightmap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55739024/calculating-texture-coordinates-from-a-heightmap/55739265#55739265), [C++]  

**By default, OpenGL assumes that the beginning of each line of an image is aligned to 4 bytes**.

**This is because the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter is 4 by default. Since the image has 3 color channels (GL_RGB) and is tightly packed, the size of one line of the image may not be aligned to 4 bytes.**.  
**If an RGB image with 3 color channels is loaded into a texture object and 3*width is not divisible by 4, [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) must be set to 1 before specifying the texture image with `glTexImage2D`**.  
Otherwise, the image memory data is accessed outside the allowed range, resulting in an exception, or the lines of the image are misaligned, resulting in a shift effect after each line.

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0,
             GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, this->diffuseData);
             
``` 

The diffuse image in the question has a dimension of 390x390. So each row of the image has a size of `390 * 3 = 1170` bytes.  
Since 1170 is not divisible by 4 (`1170 / 4 = 292,5`), the start of a row is not aligned to 4 bytes.

[Failing to map a simple unsigned byte rgb texture to a quad](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46202452/failing-to-map-a-simple-unsigned-byte-rgb-texture-to-a-quad/46203044#46203044), [C++] [GLSL]  
![Failing to map a simple unsigned byte rgb texture to a quad](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlGqd.png)

`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` specifies the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel row in memory. By default `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` is set to 4.
This means the start of each line of the image is assumed to be aligned to an address which is a multiple of 4.

You specify a 2*2 texture with the data: 255, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0

With `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` set to 4 this is interpreted as

```txt
          column 1        column 2              alignment
row 1:    255, 0,   0,    255, 0,     0,        255, 0,
row 2:    0,   255, 0,    0,   undef, undef
```

So the texture is read as

```txt
          column 1   olumn 2  
row 1:    red,       red,
row 2:    green,     RGB(0, ?, ?)
```

[Opengl texture cylinder trouble](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47111512/opengl-texture-cylinder-trouble/47113373#47113373), [C++]  
[OpenGL texture format, create image/texture data for OpenGL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46833380/opengl-texture-format-create-image-texture-data-for-opengl/46833638#46833638), [C++]  

By default, each row of a texture should be aligned to 4 bytes.
The texture is an RGB texture, which needs 24 bits or 3 bytes for each texel and the texture is tightly packed especially the rows of the texture.
This means that the alignment of 4 bytes for the start of a line of the texture is disregarded (except 3 times the width of the texture is divisible by 4 without a remaining).  
To deal with that the alignment has to be changed to 1.
This means the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter has to be set before loading a tightly packed texture to the GPU ([`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml)).  
Otherwise an offset of 0-3 bytes per line is gained, at texture lookup. This causes a continuously twisted or tilted texture.

[Error when creating textures in WebGL with the RGB format](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51582282/error-when-creating-textures-in-webgl-with-the-rgb-format)  

[Texture not showing correctly?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52460143/texture-not-showing-correctly/52460224#52460224)  

By default OpenGL assumes that the size of each row of an image is aligned 4 bytes.

This is because the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter by default is 4.

Since the image has 3 color channels (because its a JPG), and is tightly packed the size of a row of the image may not be aligned to 4 bytes.

[glTexImage2D data not filled as expected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66221801/glteximage2d-data-not-filled-as-expected/66221832#66221832)  

If an RGB image with 3 color channels is loaded into a texture object, [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) must be set to 1:

```py
gl.glPixelStorei(gl.GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1)
gl.glTexImage2D(gl.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, iformat, width, height, 0, iformat, gl.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, image)
```

`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` specifies the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel row in memory. By default `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` is set to 4.
This means the start of each line of the image is assumed to be aligned to an address which is a multiple of 4. Since the image data is tightly packed and each pixel is 3 bytes in size, the alignment has to be changed.  
If the width of the image is divisible by 4 (more exactly if `3*width` is divisible by 4) then the error is not noticeable.

Since you are reading back the texture from the GPU, you also need to change `GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT`:

```py
gl.glPixelStorei(gl.GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, 1)
p = gl.glGetTexImage(gl.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, iformat, gl.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE)
```

[C++ SOIL does not load small images](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55208514/c-soil-does-not-load-small-images/55208624#55208624)

When the image is loaded to a texture object, then [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) has to be set to 1: 

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, image);
```

Note, by default the parameter is 4. This means that each line of the image is assumed to be aligned to a size which is a multiple of 4. Since the image data are tightly packed and each pixel has a size of 3 bytes, the alignment has to be changed.

When the size of the image is 40 x 50 then the size of a line in bytes is 120, which is divisible by 4.  
But if the size of the image is 30 x 40, the the size of a line in bytes is 90, which is not divisible by 4.

[OpenGL 2D textures not displaying properly c++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55482364/opengl-2d-textures-not-displaying-properly-c/55482415#55482415), [C++]  

If an RGB image with 3 color channels is loaded into a texture object, [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) must be set to 1:

<!-- language: cpp -->

    glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGB,
                 GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, imageData);

`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` specifies the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel row in memory. By default `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` is set to 4.
This means the start of each line of the image is assumed to be aligned to an address which is a multiple of 4. Since the image data is tightly packed and each pixel is 3 bytes in size, the alignment has to be changed.  
If the width of the image is divisible by 4 (more exactly if `3*width` is divisible by 4) then the error is not noticeable.

To proper read the image the last parameter of `stbi_load` has to be 0 (since the jpg format provides 3 color channesl) or 3 (to force 3 color channels):

    unsigned char* imageData = stbi_load(filePath.c_str(),
         &width, &height, &numComponents, 0);

[Can't load “glyp” properly for opengl using freetype2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56330505/cant-load-glyp-properly-for-opengl-using-freetype2/56331113#56331113), [C++]    

The [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter defines the alignment of the first pixel in each row (line) of an image when the image is read form the buffer. By default the this parameter is 4.  
Each pixel of the glyph image is encoded in one byte and the image is tightly packed. So the the alignment of the glyph image is 1 and the parameter has to be changed before the image is read and the texture is specified: 

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
```

If that is missed, this would cause a shift effect at each line of the image (except if the width of the image is divisible by 4).

[OpenGL: Greyscale texture data layout doesn't match when the dimensions aren't divisible by 4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57346317/opengl-greyscale-texture-data-layout-doesnt-match-when-the-dimensions-arent-d/57346464#57346464), [C++]  

By default OpenGL assumes that the start of each row of an image is aligned 4 bytes.

This is because the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter by default is 4.

Since the image has 1 (RED) color channel, and is tightly packed the start of a row of the image is aligned to 4 bytes if `width=16`, but it is not aligned to 4 bytes if `width=15`.

Change the the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter to 1, before specifying the two-dimensional texture image (`glTexImage2D`):

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RED, width, width, 
             0, GL_RED, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, localBuffer);
```

Since that is missed, this cause a shift effect at each line of the image, except if the width of the image is divisible by 4.  
When the format of the image is changed to `GL_RGBA`, the the size of single pixel is 4, so the size of a line (in bytes) is divisible by 4 in any case.

[How to glReadPixels properly to write the data into QImage in Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57366251/how-to-glreadpixels-properly-to-write-the-data-into-qimage-in-linux/57368417#57368417)  

By default, the start of each row of an image is assumed to be aligned to 4 bytes. This is because the `GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT` respectively `GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT` parameter is by default 4, see [`glPixelStore`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml).  
When a framebuffer is read by [`glReadPixels`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glReadPixels.xhtml) the `GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT` parameter is considered. 

If you want to read the image in a tightly packed memory, with not alignment at the start of each line, then you've to change the `GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT` parameter to 1, before reading the color plane of the framebuffer:

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);

glReadPixels(0,0,unchangable_w, unchangable_h, GL_RED, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, tga.rpic);
glReadPixels(0,0,unchangable_w, unchangable_h, GL_GREEN, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, tga.gpic);
glReadPixels(0,0,unchangable_w, unchangable_h, GL_BLUE, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, tga.bpic); 
``` 

If that is missed, this cause a shift effect at each line of the image, except if the length of a line of the image in bytes is divisible by 4.

[Display YUV(yuv420p) is not correct on IOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58072427/display-yuvyuv420p-is-not-correct-on-ios/58077363#58077363)  

By default OpenGL assumes that the start of each row of an image is aligned 4 bytes. This is because the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter by default is 4.  
Since the images have 1 (`GL_LUMINANCE`) channel with a sizof 1 byte, and are tightly packed the start of a row is possibly misaligned.  
Change the the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter to 1, before specifying the two-dimensional texture image (`glTexImage2D`).

Note `glPixelStorei` changes a global state, so it is sufficient to set the parameter once, before the texture images are specified by `glTexImage2D`.

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
``` 

If you don't set the alignment correctly, then this causes a shift effect at row of the texture and finally the image buffer is accessed out of bounds.

Note, the issue is cause by the `width` of the first texture which is 3268. So 
`widht/2` is 1634. 1634 is not divisible by 4 (1634/4 = 408,5).  
In compare the `width` of the 2nd texture is 1280. `widht/2` is 640 and that is  divisible by 4.  
Actually  an alignment of 2 (`glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 2);`) would solve the issue, too (in this special case).

## Internal texture format

[How to render GL_SHORT in java (endian)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54797387/how-to-render-gl-short-in-java-endian/54804051#54804051)

The internal format `GL_R16` for the data store of a texture image is not a singed format, but it is an unsigned integral 16 bit format. 

I don't know which OpenGL version you are using.

Desktop OpenGL provides the internal data format `GL_R16_SNORM` which is a 16 bit signed integral data format - see [`glTexImage3D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage3D.xhtml).  
[`GL_R16_SNORM`](https://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.1.0/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/javax/media/opengl/GL2GL3.html#GL_R16_SNORM) is implemented in the interface [`GL2GL3`](https://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.1.0/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/javax/media/opengl/GL2GL3.html): 

```java
gl2.glTexImage3D(GL2.GL_TEXTURE_3D, 0, GL2GL3.GL_R16_SNORM, nCols, nRows, nSlices, 0, GL2.GL_RED, GL.GL_SHORT, data);
```

OpenGL ES (3.0) provides an singed integral 8 bit format `GL_R8_SNORM`.  
[`GL_R8_SNORM`](https://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.1.0/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/javax/media/opengl/GL2ES3.html#GL_R8_SNORM) is implemented interface [`GL2ES3`](https://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.1.0/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/javax/media/opengl/GL2ES3.html):

```java
gl2.glTexImage3D(GL2.GL_TEXTURE_3D, 0, GL2ES3.GL_R8_SNORM, nCols, nRows, nSlices, 0, GL2.GL_RED, GL.GL_SHORT, data);
```

As an alternative both, desktop OpenGL and OpenGL ES, provide a 16 floating point format:

e.g.

```java
gl2.glTexImage3D(GL2.GL_TEXTURE_3D, 0, GL2.GL_R16F, nCols, nRows, nSlices, 0, GL2.GL_RED, GL.GL_SHORT, data);
```

[OpenGL sampler2D array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72648980/opengl-sampler2d-array/72649578#72649578)

You cannot use a fragment shader input variable to index an array of texture samplers. You have to use a `sampler2DArray` (`GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY`) instead of an array of `sampler2D` (`GL_TEXTURE_2D`).

>```glsl
>int index = int(v_texIndex);
>vec4 texColor = texture(u_Textures[index], v_TexCoord);
>```

is undefined behavior because `v_texIndex` is a fragment shader input variable and therefore not a [dynamically uniform expression](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)#Dynamically_uniform_expression). See [GLSL 4.60 Specification - 4.1.7. Opaque Types](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.html#basic-types)

> [...] Texture-combined sampler types are opaque types, [...]. When aggregated into arrays within a shader, they can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform integral expression, **otherwise results are undefined**.

---

Example using `sampler2DArray`:

```glsl
#version 450 core
layout(location = 0) out vec4 color;

in vec2 v_TexCoord;
in float v_texIndex;

uniform sampler2DArray u_Textures;

void main() 
{
    color = texture(u_Textures, vec3(v_TexCoord.xy, v_texIndex));
}
```

[`texture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/texture.xhtml) is overloaded for all sampler types. The texture coordinates and texture layer need not to dynamically uniform, but the index into a sampler array has to be dynamically uniform.

I assume the you have set the texture wrap parameters for `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S` and `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T` to `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`. See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glTexParameter.xhtml).

This causes that any texture coordinate are clamped to the range `[0+1/(2*texturSize), 1-1/(2*textureSize)]`.

[GLSL Sampler2D tiling issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46664908/glsl-sampler2d-tiling-issue/46672772#46672772), [Three.js] [GLSL]  

> GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE causes ss coordinates to be clamped to the range `[1/(2*N), 1 ? 1/(2*N)]`, where `N` is the size of the texture in the direction of clamping.

>```

In three.js the texture wrap parameters can be set as follows (see [Texture](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/textures/Texture) and [Texture Constants](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/constants/Textures)):

```js
var texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load( textureFileName );
texture.wrapS = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping;
texture.wrapT = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping;
```

This means the texture coordinates, which are passed to `texture2D` are clamped, if they are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0. In fact, the  `u` (`x`) coordinate is clamped to `[0.5/width, (width-0.5)/width]` and the `v` (`y`) coordinate is clamped to `[0.5/height, (hight-0.5)/height]`.

The texture magnification function is used when the texture is magnified.  
The magnification function can be set by [`glTexParameteri`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml). Possible values are `GL_LINEAR` and `GL_NEAREST`. The initial value is `GL_LINEAR`.  
While the parameter `GL_LINEAR `would cause that the weighted average of the 4 texture elements that are closest to the specified texture coordinates are returned, `GL_NEAREST` causes that the value of the texture element that is nearest is returned, when the texture is looked up.

The initial value of `GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER` is `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR`. If you don't change it and don't create mipmaps, the texture will not be "complete" and will not be "shown" "shown". See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml).

> When I change `GL_LINEAR` to `GL_NEAREST`, nothing happens. The used texture's resolution changed to 300x300px. Why is that?

If the texture is smaller than the region where the texture is wrapped to, the the minification filter has not effect, but the magnification would have an effect. If you set the  value `GL_NEAREST` to the `GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER` then the texels are not interpolated any more.

> The `loadImage()` function make a texture. How knows PyOpenGL which texture should be used in the `makeQuad()` function?

OpenGL is a state engine. Each state is kept until you change it again, even beyond frames. Since you have bound the texture in `loadImage`

    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, bgImgGL)

the currently named texture object, which is bound to texture unit 0 is `bgImgGL`. This texture is used for drawing.

[Problems using GLTexImage3D correctly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52326761/problems-using-glteximage3d-correctly/52333776#52333776), [C#]  

The texture wrap parameters `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S`, `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T` and `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R`  are by default `GL_REPEAT`.  
The default parameters for the minifying function (`GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER`) and magnification function are (`GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER`) are `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR` respectively `GL_LINEAR`.  
See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml).

The combination of "REPEAT" and "LINEAR" causes, that the first voxel is mixed (interpolated) with the last voxel of a row, column, or depth-layer, if the the texture coordinate parameters, which is passed to the lookup function, is 0.0.

If you would use the wrap parameter `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, then the first and the last voxel won't become mixed, because the texture coordinate is clamped.  

Note the texture coordinate of the first voxel (or texel) is `1/(2*N)` and the coordinate of the last voxel is `1 - 1/(2*N)`, where `N` is the number of voxels in a row, column or layer. Because of that the coordinate 0.0, is exactly in the middle of the first and the last voxel. `GL_REPEAT` would clamp the coordinate 0.0 to `1/(2*N)`.

[How to properly upscale a texture in opengl?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53974343/how-to-properly-upscale-a-texture-in-opengl/53976359#53976359), [C++]

Lets assume you have a 2x2 texture

If this texture is wrapped on a grid of 6x6 fragments, the the center of a texel is on exactly on the texel in the middel of 3x3 tile of the 6x6 square:

![2x2 texture](image/texture/texture_2x2.png)
![2x2 texture wrapped to 6x6 quad](image/texture/texture_2x2_to_6x6.png)

The color of the other fragments depends on the the texture parameters - see [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml).

Since the texture is magnified, the `GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER` is significant.

If it is `GL_NEAREST`, then the color of the fragments is that one of the closest texel, to the texture coordinates of the fragment:

![2x2 texture filter nearest](image/texture/texture_2x2_nearest.png)

If it is `GL_LINEAR`, then the color is interpolated, by the weighted average of the 4 pixels which are closest to the texture coordinates.

The interpolation at the borders of the 6x6 quad depends on the wrap parameters `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S` and `GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T`.

If the parameters are `GL_REPEAT` (which is default), the the texture is treated as an endless texture and the interpolation of the interpolation of the color at the borders takes into account the texels on the opposite side of the texture. This is used for seamless textures and tiling:

![2x2 texture filter nearest wrap repeat](image/texture/texture_2x2_linear_repeat.png)

If it is `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, then the interpolated color at the borders is clamped to the color of the texels at the border of the texture:

The quality of minified textures can be improved by using [Trilinear filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_filtering) and [Mip Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap).

For this the texture minifying function (`gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER`) has to be set to one of `gl.NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST`, `gl.NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR`, `gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` or `gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` - See [WebGL 2.0 Specification; 3.7.6 Texture objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/#3.7.6).

This means if the texture is tiled then the even tiles are draw as the texture is and the odd tiles are drawn mirrored. 

If the texture coordinate are in [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], ..., then the *wrap* function returns a corresponding coordinate in range [0, 1].   
If the texture coordinate are in [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], ...,  then the *wrap* function returns a corresponding mirrored coordinate in range [1, 0].

The *wrap* function is applied to each coordinate separately and for each coordinate a separate, different *wrap* function can be set.

[Textures have a black color regardless of the data I put in them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57743667/textures-have-a-black-color-regardless-of-the-data-i-put-in-them/57743700#57743700) [WebGL], [[Javascript]  

You've to set the texture minifying function to a "non mipmap" filter, else the texture is not [mipmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap) complete. e.g.:

```lang-js
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
``` 

By default the minifing parameter is `NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR`. This parameter value requires a mipmap for the texture, to be complete. 

The other option is to generate mipmaps by:

```lang.js
gl.generateMipmap(gl.TEXTURE_2D)
``` 

But for that the width and the height of the texture have to be a power of two (for WebGL 1.0). See [WebGL specification - 5.13.8 Texture objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0.0/#5.13.8).

Note, if a texture is not mipmap complete, then the return value of a texel fetch is (0, 0, 0, 1), this causes the "black" color.

## Sampler

[Why are Uniform variables not working in GLSL?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61290812/why-are-uniform-variables-not-working-in-glsl/61291170#61291170), [Java]

Your shader code can't work at all, because of

>```glsl
>samplers[index]
>```

`samplers` is an array of `sampler2D` and `index` is set from the vertex shader input `samplerIndex`:

>```glsl
>int index = int(samplerIndex);
>```

See GLSL version 3.30, which you use (from [OpenGL Shading Language 3.30 Specification - 4.1.7 Samplers](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.3.30.pdf) ):

> Samplers aggregated into arrays
within a shader (using square brackets [ ]) can only be indexed with integral constant expressions
 
See GLSL version 4.60 (most recent) (from [OpenGL Shading Language 4.60 Specification - 4.1.7. Opaque Types](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.html#opaque-types)):  
(This rule applies to all the versions since GLSL 4.00)  

> When aggregated into arrays within a shader, these types can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform expression, or texture lookup will result in undefined values. 

Thus, neither in the GLSL version which you use, nor in the most recent version, array of samplers can be indexed by an vertex shader input (attribute). 

Since GLSL 4.00 it would be possible to index an array of samplers by an uniform, because indexing by a uniform variable is a [dynamically uniform expression](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)#Dynamically_uniform_expression).

I recommend to use s `sampler2DArray` (see [Sampler](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Sampler_(GLSL))) rather than an array of `sampler2D`.  
When you use a `sampler2DArray`, then you don't need any indexing at all, because  the "index" is encoded in the 3rd component of the texture coordinate at texture lookup (see [`texture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/texture.xhtml)).

You are getting the error because you have code that violates the specification. See the (most recent) [OpenGL Shading Language 4.60 Specification - 4.1.9. Arrays](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.html#basic-types):

---

What you try to do is not the create an implicitly-sized array, but an dynamically-sized array.

It is not possible to create uniform array with a variable size. A variable size is just possible for the bottommost variable in a [Shader Storage Block](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Interface_Block_(GLSL)#Shader_storage_blocks).  
Anyway you should prefer to use an `sampler2DArray` instead of an array of `sampler2D`. With a sampler array, you must use a separate texture unit for each element, and the array index must be a [Dynamically uniform expression](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)#Dynamically_uniform_expression)

The internal texture format `GL_BGR` is not valid. `GL_BGR` is a valid for the format of the source texture, but the internal representation has to be `GL_RGB`.

[android bitmap pixel format for glTexImage2D](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34705921/android-bitmap-pixel-format-for-glteximage2d/51447512#51447512), [Android]  

This issue can't be solved in OpenGL ES 1.1 but it would be solvable in OpenGL ES 3.0 or by OpenGL extension [`EXT_texture_swizzle`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_swizzle.txt):

Since OpenGL ES 3.0 you can use the texture swizzle parameters to swap the color channels. See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glTexParameter.xhtml):
> `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R`
>
>Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the r component of a texel before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param are `GL_RED`, `GL_GREEN`, `GL_BLUE`, `GL_ALPHA`, `GL_ZERO` and `GL_ONE`. If `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R` is `GL_RED`, the value for r will be taken from the first channel of the fetched texel. If `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R` is `GL_GREEN`, the value for r will be taken from the second channel of the fetched texel. ...

This means the color channels will be swapped when the texture is looked up, when you set the following texture parameters to the texture object: 

```java  
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, GL_GREEN);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G, GL_BLUE);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, GL_ALPHA);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A, GL_RED);
```

The relevant part in the specification can be found at [OpenGL ES 3.0.5 Specification; 3.8.14 Texture State; page 162](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.pdf)

To check if an OpenGL extension is valid, [`glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es1.1/xhtml/glGetString.xml) can be use, which returns a space-separated list of supported extensions.

A completely different solution would be to use a [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas) for the conversion. Draw the [`Bitmap`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap#copy(android.graphics.Bitmap))  on the canvas, and then use the target bitmap, which is hold by the canvas.<br/>
I found this solution on GitHub: [fix android 2.3 can't decode bitmap in rgba8888 format](https://gist.github.com/kyze8439690/7408999)

[Why do the textured image colors are not the same as the origin?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51994952/why-do-the-textured-image-colors-are-not-the-same-as-the-origin/52000706#52000706), [Java]  

At OpenGL there is the possibility, to use the `GL_BGR` format, which specifies a internal format where the color channels are swapped (in compare to GL_`RGB`).

See [OpenGL 4 Refpages - `glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) and [OpenGL Renders texture with different color than original image?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4093190/opengl-renders-texture-with-different-color-than-original-image).

At OpenGL ES you have to manually swap the red and blue color channel, because the internal format `GL_BGR` is missing.

See [OpenGL ES 3.0 Refpages - `glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml)
and [lwjgl - `class GL11`](http://legacy.lwjgl.org/javadoc/org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html).

```java
pixels = BufferUtils.createByteBuffer(bytePixels.length);
pixels.put(bytePixels);
pixels.flip();
for (int i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 3) {
    byte t = pixels[i];
    pixels[i] = pixels[i+2];
    pixels[i+2] = t;
}
```

Another possibility would be given in OpenGL ES 3.0 or by OpenGL extension [`EXT_texture_swizzle`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_swizzle.txt):

Since OpenGL ES 3.0 you can use the texture swizzle parameters to swap the color channels. See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glTexParameter.xhtml):

[Surface poorly filled with sdl_ttf](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938402/surface-poorly-filled-with-sdl-ttf/57941915#57941915), [C++]  

The format and type parameter of [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml)specifiy how e single pixel is encoded.  
When the texture font is created, then each pixel is encoded to a single byte. This means your texture consist of a single color channel and each pixel has 1 byte.
Im very sure that `colors = surface->format->BytesPerPixel` is 1.
Note that it is completely sufficient to encode the glyph in one color channel, because there glyph just consists of a information.

By default OpenGL assumes that the start of each row of an image is aligned 4 bytes. This is because the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter by default is 4. Since the image has 1 (RED) color channel, and is tightly packed the start of a row is possibly misaligned.  
Change the the [`GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter to 1, before specifying the two-dimensional texture image (`glTexImage2D`).

Since the texture has only one (red) color channel, the green an blue color will be 0 and the alpha channel will be 1 when the texture is looked up. But you can treat green, blue and even the alpha channel to be read from the red color channel, too.
This can be achieved by setting the texture swizzle parameters `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G`, `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B` respectively `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A`. See [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml).

Further not that the texture parameter are stored in the texture object. `glTexParameter` changes the texture object which is currently bound to the specified targetof the current texture unit. So it is sufficient to set the parameters once when the texture image is created.  
In compare [`glPixelStore`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) changes global states an ma have to be set to its default value after specifying the texture image (if later calls to `glTexImage2D` rely on it).  

The specification of the 2 dimensional texture image and setting the parameters may look as follows:

```cpp
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_R8, surface->w, surface->h, 0,
             GL_RED, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, surface->pixels);
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 4);

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G, GL_RED);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, GL_RED);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A, GL_RED);

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);

## Texture unit and texture binding

If a values is assigned to a uniform, the the uniform has to be identified by the uniform location index. See [Uniform (GLSL)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Uniform_(GLSL))  

The fist parameter of [`glUniform1i`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glUniform.xhtml) has to be the location of the uniform and not the named texture object.

The location of a uniform can be set explicit, in shader by a [Layout Qualifier](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Layout_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Program_separation_linkage)

e.g.

```glsl
layout(location = 7) uniform sampler2D u_gloss;
```

```cpp
initTexture(2, m_glossMapTex, "images/gloss.png");
glUniform1i(7, 2); // uniform location 7
```

If the location of the uniform is not set by a layout qualifier, then the uniform location is set automatically when the program is linked. You can ask for this location by [`glGetUniformLocation`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGetUniformLocation.xhtml):

e.g.

```glsl
uniform sampler2D u_texture;
```

```cpp
GLuint program_obj = ... ;
GLint tex_location = glGetUniformLocation(program_obj , "u_texture");

GLuint tex_obj_A = ... ;
GLuint tex_obj_B = ... ;

int unit_tex0 = 0;
int unit_tex1 = 1;

glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + unit_tex0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex_obj_A);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + unit_tex1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex_obj_B);
```

Since GLSL version 4.2 this can be done in the fragment shader by specifying binding points - See [OpenGL Shading Language 4.20 Specification - 4.4.4 Opaque-Uniform Layout Qualifiers; page 60](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.20.pdf):

```glsl
#version 420

layout (binding = 0) uniform sampler2D u_texture0;
layout (binding = 1) uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
```

In glsl uniform variables are default initialized by 0 respectively 0.0. So the value of the texture sampler uniform `textureObj` is initialized by (texture unit) 0, too.

Further there is the default texture object (0). If you don't create and bind a named texture object, then there is still the default texture object (0), and [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) specifies the texture image of the default texture object (0).

[How do you "free" a texture unit?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50113147/how-do-you-free-a-texture-unit/50113279#50113279), [C++]

You can't "free" the texture unit, but you can bind the default texture object to the texture unit.

> See [OpenGL 4.6 API Compatibility Profile Specification; 8.1 Texture Objects; page 178](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.compatibility.pdf):

This means

```cpp
GLuint defaultTextureObjectID = 0;
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, defaultTextureObjectID);
```

will bind the default texture object to texture unit 0.

Since OpenGL 4.5 it can be used
[`glBindTextureUnit`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTextureUnit.xhtml)

> The command
>
>     void BindTextureUnit( uint unit, uint texture );
>
>binds an existing texture object to the **texture unit numbered `unit`**. `texture` **must be zero or the name of an existing texture object**. When `texture` is the name of an existing texture object, that object is bound to the target, in the corresponding texture unit, that was specified when the object was created.

The following too:

```cpp
glBindTextureUnit( 0, 0 ); // texture unit 0, default texture object (0)
```

[Can't texture and transform at the same time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54133596/cant-texture-and-transform-at-the-same-time/54135029#54135029), [C++]  

You confuse the location of the texture sampler uniform variable and the texture unit.

The location of the uniform variable is an active program resource, which can be get by [`glGetUniformLocation`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGetUniformLocation.xhtml): 

```cpp 
const auto Textureloc = glGetUniformLocation(ourShader.Program, "ourTexture");
```

But you can choose a [texture unit](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Texture#Texture_image_units) a texture unit, and bind the texture to this unit.  
Then you have to set the texture unit index value to the texture sampler uniform:

e.g.


```cpp
GLuint unit = 3;
glBindTextureUnit(unit, texture);
glUniform1i(Textureloc, unit);
```

Note, the texture unit is the link between the shader program and the texture object.

See [OpenGL 4.6 API Compatibility Profile Specification; 7.10 Samplers; page 154](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.compatibility.pdf):

> Samplers are special uniforms used in the OpenGL Shading Language to identify
the texture object used for each texture lookup. The value of a sampler indicates the texture image unit being accessed. Setting a sampler’s value to `i` selects texture image unit number `i`. 

The former code has worked and you have "seen" the texture because, if you the uniform variable "transform" is not used, then the uniform is not active and doesn't get a uniform location. So `"ourTexture"` is the only uniform left and likely has the uniform location 0 (`Textureloc == 0`).  
Since the value of `"ourTexture"` is not set explicitly, its value is the default value 0.  
In this special case the texture unit, the location `Textureloc` and the value of `"ourTexture"` are equal, they are all 0. Your code worked coincidentally. 

Since GLSL version 4.2, the texture unit can be set by a [Layout Qualifier (GLSL)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Layout_Qualifier_(GLSL)) within the shader, too. The [Binding point]( https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Layout_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Binding_points) corresponds to the texture unit:

```cpp
GLuint unit = 3;
glBindTextureUnit(unit, texture); 
```

Vertex shader: `binding = 3` means texture unit 3

```glsl
layout(binding = 3) uniform sampler2D ourTexture;
```

[Correspondance between texture units and sampler uniforms in opengl](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54931941/correspondance-between-texture-units-and-sampler-uniforms-in-opengl/54932052#54932052)  


You have to set the index of the texture unit to sampler uniform (similar as setting the value of a uniform variable of type `int`). e.g. value 1 for  `GL_TEXTURE1`.

See [OpenGL 4.6 API Compatibility Profile Specification; 7.10 Samplers; page 154](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.compatibility.pdf):

> Samplers are special uniforms used in the OpenGL Shading Language to identify
the texture object used for each texture lookup. The value of a sampler indicates the texture image unit being accessed. Setting a sampler’s value to `i` selects texture image unit number `i`. 

e.g.

```glsl
layout (location = 11) uniform sampler2D color;
layout (location = 12) uniform sampler2D tex;
layout (location = 13) uniform sampler2D norm;
```

```cpp
glUniform1i(11, 0); // 0: GL_TEXTURE0
glUniform1i(12, 1); // 1: GL_TEXTURE1
glUniform1i(13, 2); // 2: GL_TEXTURE2
```

Since GLSL version 4.2 this can be done in the fragment shader by specifying binding points - See [OpenGL Shading Language 4.20 Specification - 4.4.4 Opaque-Uniform Layout Qualifiers; page 60](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.20.pdf):

[Should I write logic in fragment shader in this case?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54280392/should-i-write-logic-in-fragment-shader-in-this-case/54294601#54294601), [GLSL]  

Create a 1x1 texture with a single (white) color and use it for the uniform colored cubes.
Binding and using this texture is much "cheaper" than changing the shader program: 

<!-- language: lang-js -->

```pp
let whiteTexture = gl.createTexture();
gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, whiteTexture);
gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, 1, 1, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,
                new Uint8Array([255,255,255,255]));
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);
```

Note, the lookup to this texture (`texture2D(u_texture, TextureCoordinates)`) will always return `vec4(1.0)`.

If the texture is bound (to the texture unit which is assigned to `u_texture`), then  

```glsl
FragColor = Color * texture2D(u_texture, TextureCoordinates);
```

will sets the same fragment color as

```glsl
FragColor = Color * vec4(1.0); 
```

[OpenGL: Some clarification on using multiple textures or texture units](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57621863/opengl-some-clarification-on-using-multiple-textures-or-texture-units/57622525#57622525), [C++]  

If you want to use multiple 2 dimensional textures in one shader program, then you've to bind the different texture objects to different texture units.  
It is not necessary that the proper texture unit is selected ([`glActiveTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glActiveTexture.xhtml)) when the   texture name (value) is generated ([`glGenTextures`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGenTextures.xhtml)) or when the texture image is specified ([`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml)), but the texture has to be bound to the proper texture unit before the object (mesh) is drawn by the use of the shader program.

The binding between the texture sampler uniform in the shader program and the texture object is achieved, by binding the texture to a texture unit and setting the number of the texture unit to uniform variable.

The value of the uniform can either be set by [`glUniform1i`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glUniform.xhtml)

```cpp
texUniformID[0] = glGetUniformLocation(myShaderProgram, "tex1");
texUniformID[1] = glGetUniformLocation(myShaderProgram, "tex2");
glUniform1i(texUniformID[0], 0);
glUniform1i(texUniformID[1], 1);
```   

or in-shader by a [Binding point](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Layout_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Binding_points) layout qualifier:

```glsl
layout(binding = 0) uniform sampler2D tex1;
```

```glsl
layout(binding = 1) uniform sampler2D tex2;
``` 

Since the binding points are 0 and 1, the texture objects have to be bound to the texture units 0 (`GL_TEXTURE0 `) and 1 (`GL_TEXTURE1`), before drawing the geometry with the shader program:

```cpp
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[0]);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[1]);

glDrawElements(...);
```

But it is not necessary to select the texture unit 0 respectively 1, when the texture is "created":

```cpp
glGenTextures(2, texName);

// Initialize first texture
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[0]);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_R32F, xDim0, yDim0, 0, GL_RED, GL_FLOAT, data1);

// Initialize second texture
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[1]);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, xDim1, yDim1, 0, GL_RGB, GL_FLOAT, data2);
```

Of course you can select a texture unit before creating the textures, then it is superfluous to bind them later. But note, `glGenTextures` doesn't create a texture object, it just reserves names (values) which can be used for texture objects. The texture is created when the name (value) the first time is bound to a texturing target by [`glBindTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTexture.xhtml). This means `glBindTexture` creates a texture if it doesn't exist or it use the existing texture. [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) specifies, creates and initialize the image of the existing texture object which is bound to the specified target of the current texture unit:

```cpp
glGenTextures(2, texName);

// Initialize first texture
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[0]);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_R32F, xDim0, yDim0, 0, GL_RED, GL_FLOAT, data1);

// Initialize second texture
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[1]);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, xDim1, yDim1, 0, GL_RGB, GL_FLOAT, data2);
```

---

[`glTexSubImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexSubImage2D.xhtml) updates the content of a texture image of the texture object which is currently bound to the specified target of the current texture unit. All you've to do is to bind the texture object. 

```cpp
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[0]);
glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, ...);
``` 

But note that `glBindTexture` binds the texture to the currently selected texture unit, so it may mess up your combinations of texture objects and texture units, if the "wrong" texture unit is currently selected (The current texture unit is a global state). So it may make sense to select the proper texture unit. If the texture object is still bound to the texture unit, it is unnecessary to bind it agian:

```cpp
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texName[0]); // <-- this is possibly unnecessary
glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, ...);
``` 

---

Of course different shader programs can use the same binding points. But note that the number of texture units is limited. If you've a lot of textures it is not possible to bind each texture object to a different texture unit. But, if you've 2 texture objects and different shader programs it is handy to bind the 2 texture objects to different texture inits and to (re)use the same binding points in each shader program.

[binding buffers multiple times in openGL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60221462/binding-buffers-multiple-times-in-opengl/60222446#60222446)  

[`glBindTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTexture.xhtml) binds a texture to specified target and the current texture unit. The current texture unit is set by [`glActiveTexture`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glActiveTexture.xhtml). The current texture unit is a global state, and `glBindTexture` considers that state.

That meas when you do

```cpp
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture2);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1); 
``` 

after that `texture2` is bound to the current texture unit (`GL_TEXTURE0` by default) and the current texture unit is `GL_TEXTURE1`. Note `texture1`  
is just bound for a short moment, but the binding is lost, when `texture2` is bound.

In compare, when you do

```cpp
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture1);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1); 
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture2);
``` 

The current texture unit is explicitly set to `GL_TEXTURE0` and `texture1` is bound to texture texture unit 0. After that the current texture unit is switched to `GL_TEXTURE1` and  `texture2` is bound to texture unit 1 (because it is current at this moment). 

---

Note, with the use of [Direct State Access](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access) and [`glBindTextureUnit`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBindTextureUnit.xhtml) (since OpenGL 4.5) a texture can be bound to a texture unit directly. e.g.:

```cpp
glBindTextureUnit(GL_TEXTURE0, texture1);
glBindTextureUnit(GL_TEXTURE1, texture2);
```

Texture coordinates map the vertices (points) of the geometry to a point in the texture image. Thereby it is specified which part of the texture is placed on an specific part of the geometry  and together with the texture parameters (see [`glTexParameter`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexParameter.xhtml)) it specifies how the geometry  is wrapped by the texture.  
In general, the lower left point of the texture is addressed by the texture coordinate (0, 0) and the upper right point of the texture is addressed by (1, 1).

## UV wrapping

[Cylindrical UV mapping](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53408154/cylindrical-uv-mapping/53409228#53409228), [GLSL]  

The vertex coordinates at the seam of the texture, where the *u* component of the texture coordinate is 0, has to be duplicated, because it has to be associated to a texture coordinate where *u==1*, too. 
At the seam of the texture which is wrapped around the circumference of the rotation body, the u coordinate starts with the value 0, but it ends on the same point with the value 1.

If you don`t do so, a transition from the last point on the circumference to the first point is generated. There is no clear seam where the texture ends and starts again, but there is linear transition from somewhere near the end of the texture to its begin. The entire texture is squeezed in this small transition area (flipped along the y axis).

The texture coordinate of `textureCube` is a 3D direction vector, it does a 3-dimensional look up. Cube map textures are not sampled like 2D textures. The direction goes out of the center of the cube, which is surrounded by its 6 sides. The texel on the side which is hit by the direction vector is returend by `textureCube`. The length of the direction vector does not affect the result.

See Khronos documentation [Cubemap Texture Access](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Cubemap_Texture)
>The sampler type for cubemaps is `gsamplerCube`.
The texture coordinates for cubemaps are 3D vector directions. These are conceptually directions from the center of the cube to the texel you want to appear. The vectors do not have to be normalized.

This means that scaling the texture coordinate does **not** cause different results.

When a cubemap texture is used, then a 3 dimensional direction vector has to be transformed, to 2 dimensional texture coordinate relative to one side of the map.

The relevant part of the specification for this transformtion is [OpenGL 4.6 API Core Profile Specification, 8.13 Cube Map Texture Selection](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf#page=275&zoom=100,0,614), page 253:

> When a cube map texture is sampled, the `(s t r)` texture coordinates are treated as a direction vector `(rx ry rz)` emanating from the center of a cube. The `q` coordinate is ignored. At texture application time, the interpolated per-fragment direction vector selects one of the cube map face’s two-dimensional images based on the largest magnitude coordinate direction (the major axis direction). If two or more coordinates have the identical magnitude, the implementation may define the rule to disambiguate this situation. The rule must be deterministic and depend only on `(rx ry rz)`. The target column in table 8.19 explains how the major axis direction maps to the two-dimensional image of a particular cube map target.
Using the `sc`, `tc`, and `ma` determined by the major axis direction as specified in table 8.19, an updated `(s t)`
is calculated as follows:

>     --------------------+---------------------------+---+---+---+

`sc` cooresponds the u coordiante and `tc` to the `v` cooridnate. So `tc` has to be in the direction of the view space up vector 

---

Look at the first row of the table:

>     +rx | TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X | −rz | −ry | rx

This means, for the X+ side (right side) of the cube map, the directions which correspond to the tangent and binormal are 

```
sc = (0, 0, -1)
tc = (0, -1, 0)
``` 

This perfectly matches the 1st row of the table `glm::mat4 captureViews[]`:

>     glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), glm::vec3(0.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f))

because the major direction is given by the line of sight, which is the directon form the eye position to the target (`los = target - eye`) and so (1, 0, 0).  
The up vector (or  `ts`) is (0, -1, 0).  
`sc` is given by the cross product of the line of sight and the up vector (0, 0, -1).

## Texture read

[Pixel access with glGetTexImage()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48938930/pixel-access-with-glgetteximage/48941809#48941809), [C++]

The size of the array in bytes is 1048576 bytes (`256 * 256 * 4 * sizeof(GLuint)`). This is, because every color channel of a single pixel is stored in a separate `GLuint` with a size of 4 bytes (`sizeof(GLuint) == 4`). So the size of each pixel is 16 bytes because of 4 color channels per pixel and `sizeof(GLuint)` for each color channel.

Probably it will be sufficient to store every color in an `GLubyte`. Then the size of the array will be 262144 bytes (`256 * 256 * 4 * sizeof(GLubyte)`)

[`glGetTexImage`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGetTexImage.xhtml) doesn't exist in OpenGL ES.  
In OpenGL ES, you have to attach the texture to a framebuffer and read the color plane of the framebuffer by [`glReadPixels`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glReadPixels.xhtml)

```cpp
int data_size = mWidth * mHeight * 4;
GLubyte* pixels = new GLubyte[mWidth * mHeight * 4];

GLuint textureObj = ...; // the texture object - glGenTextures  

GLuint fbo;
glGenFramebuffers(1, &fbo); 
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fbo);
glFramebufferTexture2D(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureObj, 0);

glReadPixels(0, 0, mWidth, mHeight, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels);

glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);

[How can I read the texture data so I can edit it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54812864/how-can-i-read-the-texture-data-so-i-can-edit-it/54813349#54813349)

The texture is attached to a framebuffer. Either read the pixels from the framebuffer or read the texture image from the texture.

The pixels of the framebuffer can be read by [`glReadPixels`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glReadPixels.xhtml). Bind the framebuffer for reading and read the pixels:

```cpp
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, ssaoFBO);
glReadBuffer(GL_FRONT);
glReadPixels(0, 0, width, height, format, type, pixels);
```

The texture image can be read by [`glGetTexImage`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGetTexImage.xhtml). Bind the texture and read the data:

```cpp
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, ssaoTexture);
glGetTexImage(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, format, type, pixels);
```

In both cases `format` and `type` define the pixel format of the target data.  
e.g. If you want to store the pixels to an buffer with 4 color channels which 1 byte for each channel then `format = GL_RGBA` and `type = GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE`.  
The size of the target buffer has to be `widht * height * 4`.

e.g.

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

```cpp
int width = ...;
int height = ...;
std::vector<GLbyte> pixels(width * height * 4); // 4 because of RGBA * 1 byte

glReadPixels(0, 0, width, height, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels.data());
```

or

```cpp
glGetTexImage(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels.data());
```

Note, if the size in bytes of 1 row of the image, is not dividable by 4, then the [`GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glPixelStore.xhtml) parameter has to be set, to adapt the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel row. 

e.g. for an tightly packed `GL_RGB` image:

```cpp
int width = ...;
int height = ...;
std::vector<GLbyte> pixels(width * height * 3); // 3 because of RGB * 1 byte

glPixelStorei(GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glGetTexImage(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels.data());  
```

[How to get texture data using textureID's in openGL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5117653/how-to-get-texture-data-using-textureids-in-opengl/62965713#62965713)  

In OpneGL a texture can be read by [`glGetTexImage`/`glGetnTexImage`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glGetTexImage.xhtml) respectively the DSA version of the function `glGetTextureImage`.

Another possibility is to attach the texture to a framebuffer and to read the pixel by [`glReadPixels`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glReadPixels.xhtml). OpenGL ES does not offer a `glGetTexImage`, so this is the way to OpenGL ES.  
See [opengl es 2.0 android c++ glGetTexImage alternative](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53993820/opengl-es-2-0-android-c-glgetteximage-alternative/53993894#53993894)  

---

If you transfer the texture image to a [Pixel Buffer Object](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Pixel_Buffer_Object), then you can even access the data via [Buffer object mapping](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object#Mapping). See also [OpenGL Pixel Buffer Object (PBO)](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_pbo.html).  
You've to bind a buffer with the proper size to the target `GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER`:

```c
// create buffer
GLuint pbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &pbo);
glBindBuffer(GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, pbo);
glBufferData(GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, size_in_bytes, 0, GL_STATIC_READ);

// get texture image
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_obj);
glGetTexImage(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, (void*)(0));

// map pixel buffer
void * data_ptr = glMapBuffer(GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, GL_READ_ONLY);

// access the data
// [...]

glUnmapBuffer(GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER);
```

When texturing is activated, by default the color of the texel is multiplied by the current color, because by default the texture environment mode (`GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE`) is `GL_MODULATE`. See [`glTexEnv`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glTexEnv.xml).

This causes that the color of the texels of the texture is "mixed" by the last color which you have set by [`glColor4f`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glColor.xml).

Set a "white" color before you render the texture, to solve your issue:

```cpp
glColor3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
```

Likewise you can change the environment mode to `GL_REPLACE`, instead:

```cpp
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_REPLACE);
```

## Image Load Store

Image load/store is the ability of Shaders to more-or-less arbitrarily read from and write to images:

## Bindless Textures

Bindless Textures are a method for passing Textures to Shader by a name, rather than by binding them to the OpenGL Context.
These texture can be used by samplers or images.

**Bindless Textures are not part of the OpenGL standard yet (OpenGL 4.6)**.

- [Bindless Texture](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Bindless_Texture)

## Texture and Renderbuffer

[Image Format](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Format)

These formats are required for both textures and renderbuffers. Any of the combinations presented in each row is a required format.

| Base format   | Data type           | Bitdepth per component |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| RGBA, RG, RED | unsigned normalized | 8, 16                  |
| RGBA, RG, RED | float               | 16, 32                 |
| RGBA, RG, RED | signed integral     | 8, 16, 32              |
| RGBA, RG, RED | unsigned integral   | 8, 16, 32              |

Also, the following other formats must be supported for both textures and renderbuffers:

- `GL_RGB10_A2`
- `GL_RGB10_A2UI`
- `GL_R11F_G11F_B10F`
- `GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8`
- `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16`
- `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24`
- `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32F`
- `GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8`
- `GL_DEPTH32F_STENCIL8`
- `GL_STENCIL_INDEX8`

 There is a big difference between the *internalFormat* (3rd) paramter and the *format* (7th) paramter of [`glTexImage2D`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml). The former specifies the format of the target texture (GPU) and the later specifies together, with the *type* (8th) paramter, the format of the source texture (CPU). This causes that the parameters may need different enum constants. If this paramters are not proper set this may cause an `GL_INVALID_ENUM` error (1281).

## Texture - WebGL

[WebGL texImage2D parameters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53899162/webgl-teximage2d-parameters/53899276#53899276), [WebGL]  

See [WebGL Specification - 5.14 The WebGL context](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#5.14):

>     [...]
>     void texImage2D(GLenum target, GLint level, GLint internalformat,
>                     GLsizei width, GLsizei height, GLint border, GLenum format,
>                     GLenum type, [AllowShared] ArrayBufferView? pixels);

>                     GLenum format, GLenum type, TexImageSource source); // May throw DOMException

Since image is `image` is a `TexImageSource` it has to be

<s>`gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, 10, 10, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, image);`</s>
`gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, image);`

Note, the size of the bitmap is encode int the `image` object.

## Texture - three.js

[How can I map a texture image onto a shader geometry?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53999716/how-can-i-map-a-texture-image-onto-a-shader-geometry/54003812#54003812), [three.js]  

In the fragment shader has to be declared a [uniform](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Uniform_(GLSL)) variable of type `sampler2D`:

[Vertex Shader](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Shader):

```glsl
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
}
```

[Fragment Shader](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader):

```glsl
precision highp float;

uniform sampler2D u_texture; // <---------------------------------- texture sampler uniform

varying vec2 vUv;

void main(){
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(u_texture, vUv);
}
```

With the shaders a [`THREE.ShaderMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/ShaderMaterial) can be created.

First load the texture:

```js
var texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load ('js/textures/earth.jpg');
```

Then specify the set of [Uniform](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Uniform)s (in this case there is the texture uniform only):  

```js
var uniforms = {
    u_texture: {type: 't', value: texture}
};
``` 

Finally create the material:

```js
var material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({  
    uniforms: uniforms,
    vertexShader: document.getElementById('vertex-shader').textContent,
    fragmentShader: document.getElementById('fragment-shader').textContent
});
```

The material can be used in the same manner as any other material.
