## Intersection of a line and a plane

![intersect line and plane](image/intersection_ray_plane_R0.png)

The ray is defined by a point `R0` and a direction `D`.<br/>
The plane is defined by a triangle with the three points `PA`, `PB`, and `PC`.

The normal vector of the plane can be calculated by the cross product of 2 legs of the triangle:

```txt
N  =  cross(PC-PA, PB-PA)
```

The normal distance `n` of the point `R0` to the plane is:

```txt
n  =  | R0 - PA | * cos(alpha)  =  dot(PA - R0, N)
```

It follows that the distance `d` of the intersection point `X` to the origin of the ray R0 is:

```txt
d  =  n / cos(beta)  =  n / dot(D, N)
```

The intersection point `X` is:

```txt
X  =  R0 + D * d  =  R0 + D * dot(PA - R0, N) / dot(D, N)
```

### Intersection of the Line of Sight and the Viewport

![intersect line of sight and viewport](image/isect_los_plane.png)

```txt
P0  ... any known point on the viewport
Z   ... Z-axis of the viewport 
C   ... camera position
LOS ... line of sight

X  =  C + LOS * dot(P0 - C, Z) / dot(LOS, Z)
```
